## Window :

Actually it is like a big object, with lot of functions and methods. And this function and methods are created by JS Engine into Global scope .
And Just like window , Javascript Engine also created this keyword. (And at the Global level this refer to window)

Note :- Javascript Engine - where our code runs behind the scenes in execution context.

Global scope - It is nothing, any code you right inside javascript but not inside any function is called Global scope.
